          Unlike most gaming communities, we mostly hang out in our teamspeak server. Teamspeak is a voice chat client, like Ventrillo, or Mumble, but a little bit more powerful. There is a link to their website below, with a download after the link. You are welcome to join us, even if you don't have a microphone, or if you dont want to talk!</p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.teamspeak.com/" class="big-btn">Visit TeamSpeak.com</a>
          <a id="join-teamspeak" href="ts3server://ts.st-gc.org/?port=9987" class="big-btn">Join the TeamSpeak</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          If that link doesnt work, connect to "ts.st-gc.org" in your teamspeak client.<br />
          We also have a forum running. Check it out by clicking the link below.
